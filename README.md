Ruby Hangman-game

USER
-user interface-
Built hangman-game with Ruby. 
This helped me understand more with the language and to have fun at the same time. 
Created a Ruby file to run our Ruby game. When the Ruby script is called, it will start a new game and provide the user with a blank word and a clue.
The script takes the user input (letter) and checks it against the selected word for the game.
Make too many wrong choices and you will lose. Get all the letters correct to win!
